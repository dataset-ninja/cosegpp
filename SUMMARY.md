**Cosegmentation for Plant Phenotyping** is a dataset for semantic segmentation and instance segmentation tasks. It is applicable or relevant across various domains. Also, it is used in the agricultural industry and agricultural research. 

The dataset consists of 496 images with 496 labeled objects belonging to 4 different classes including *Sunflower-C-1*, *Sunflower-D-1*, *Buckwheat-C-1*, and other: *Buckwheat-D-1*.

Images in the CosegPP dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into an object detection (bounding boxes for every object) task. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 4 splits in the dataset: *Buckwheat-C-1* (84 images), *Sunflower-C-1* (164 images), *Buckwheat-D-1* (84 images), and *Sunflower-D-1* (164 images). The dataset was released in 2021.

Here are the visualized examples for each of the 4 classes:
