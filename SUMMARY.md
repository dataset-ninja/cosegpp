**CosegPP: Cosegmentation for Plant Phenotyping** is a dataset for semantic segmentation and instance segmentation tasks. It is used in the agricultural industry, and in the agricultural research. 

The dataset consists of 496 images with 496 labeled objects belonging to 4 different classes including *sunflower-C-1*, *sunflower-D-1*, *buckwheat-C-1*, and other: *buckwheat-D-1*.

Images in the CosegPP dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into an object detection (bounding boxes for every object) task. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 4 splits in the dataset: *sunflower-C-1* (164 images), *sunflower-D-1* (164 images), *buckwheat-C-1* (84 images), and *buckwheat-D-1* (84 images). For the sake of improving the experience when working with this dataset, we have decided to group the images by date. This way, you can work simultaneously with every image of a plant in every modality and angle. This grouping is only visible in advanced labeling toolbox.. The dataset was released in 2021 by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.
