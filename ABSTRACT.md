Cosegmentation, an emerging computer vision technique, simultaneously processes multiple images to segment objects from backgrounds. Traditional plant phenotyping relies on thresholding segmentation, but machine learning methods often depend on specific features in training sets. This dataset features Buckwheat and Sunflower plants under various conditions, leveraging high-throughput phenotyping. In the original paper, authors evaluate this dataset with different cosegmentation algorithms and a standard plant phenotyping method, aiming to establish a benchmark for segmentation accuracy and methodology improvement.

**CosegPP** is part of a broader dataset obtained from the LemnaTec Scanalyzer system at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, a 3D plant phenotyping system. This extensive dataset includes various plant species, imaging modalities, temporal points, and experimental samples. The LemnaTec system has four imaging chambers, each with specific camera types for capturing different perspectives, including visible light, infrared, fluorescent, and near-infrared. Chamber lifters enable versatile imaging, creating a rich dataset.

CosegPP has *Buckwheat-C-1*, *Buckwheat D-1*, *Sunflower-C-1*, and *Sunflower-D-1* as datasets. Dataset name starts with the name of the plant. C indicates control, D indicates drought, and 1 represents the plant ID number. Each dataset has 12 groups that are labeled with combinations of the three ***modalities*** (fluorescence, IR, Vis), perspectives (SV), and degree ***angles*** (0, 72, 144, 216) the photo was taken. Some example groups are: Fluo_SV_0, IR_SV_72, Vis_SV_144. Each group has a range of PNG images named after timestamps.

Ground truth images were generated using Photoshop2020's Action feature, which involved Quick Selection, Masking, Mode Conversion, Thresholding, and Inversion steps. Following the creation of a binary mask, two computer scientists assessed and refined each mask for quality by adding or removing pixels. This process resulted in a binary mask for each timestamp, modality, and perspective. Previous studies have also employed Photoshop, either fully or partially, for manual techniques in producing binary masks.
